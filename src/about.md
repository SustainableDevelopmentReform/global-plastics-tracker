# About

**The tracker was developed via a rapid assessment in the run up to INC-5 – the analysts therefore welcome users to improve the sources and provide feedback to [helena.dickinson@unsw.edu.au](mailto:helena.dickinson@unsw.edu.au) or [e.northrop@unsw.edu.au](mailto:e.northrop@unsw.edu.au).**

The Global Plastics Data tracker indicates where there are gaps in government published plastics data across the supply-chain. The tracker also provides access to the sources of individual data points for each country, across the whole supply-chain.

Each data point has been assigned a "Data score" which indicates how suitable the data is for informing annual flows of plastic in the country.
