## About the data ratings and methods
The Global Plastics Data tracker indicates where there are gaps in government published plastics data across the supply-chain. The tracker also provides access to the sources of individual data points for each country, across the whole supply-chain.

Each data point has been assigned a "Data score" which indicates how suitable the data is for informing annual flows of plastic in the country.

| Description | Data score |
|-------------|------------|
| *All categories:* Data published annually (split by plastics) | 5 |
| *All categories:* Irregular publication of data (split by plastics)<br>*Consumption only:* Plastics production data not split by virgin/recycled content | 4 |
