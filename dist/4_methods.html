<p>Each data point has been assigned a “Data score” which indicates how suitable the data point is for informing annual flows of plastic in the country. The highest data score is assigned to the data points that report plastic-specific data and are reported annually. Lower data scores are given to data points that do not refer to plastic-specific data, and/or data that is published infrequently, and/or only for certain regions/provinces/states in the country.</p>

<h2 id="limitations" tabindex="-1"><a class="observablehq-header-anchor" href="#limitations">Limitations</a></h2>
<p>Whilst using search strings, only the first two pages of the search engine (Google) were reviewed. If a data source was not found on the first two pages, the data point was assigned “not found”. This does not mean the data is not available, only that it was not found during our search.</p>
<p>A reason for this may be due to language differences – all of our searches used English phrases, but where countries do not translate their websites to English, the sources may not have been picked up. In addition, some countries may collect data, but not report it.</p>
<p>For primary plastics production specifically, some countries may not report this data because they do not produce primary plastics in their country.</p>
<h2 id="scope" tabindex="-1"><a class="observablehq-header-anchor" href="#scope">Scope</a></h2>
<p>Only government published data has been captured in the tracker. There are therefore a number of plastic-related publications that might be helpful for countries to develop plastic accounts (plastics data that follows a standardised collection methodology and is reproducible periodically), that have not been included in this iteration of the tracker. These included publications by IUCN, the UN, the European union, SPREP, SEEA, academic organisations and other consultancy organisations.</p>
<p>In order for data to be captured in the tracker, it needs to have met at least one of the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Be published on the government website or;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have been part-funded and publicly endorsed by the relevant government or;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be published on a global platform that publishes data submitted by Government (e.g., Eurostat or COMTRADE).</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h5 id="european-data" tabindex="-1"><a class="observablehq-header-anchor" href="#european-data">European data</a></h5>
<p>Eurostat was used in the first instance to identify European Countries that reported Primary Plastic Production data.</p>
<p>Eurostat allows users to filter total production of “Plasticised polyvinyl chloride mixed with any other substance, in primary forms”. Where countries reported this data, it was assumed that they collected and reported data on “Domestic Primary Plastic Production”.</p>
<h5 id="search-strings" tabindex="-1"><a class="observablehq-header-anchor" href="#search-strings">Search strings</a></h5>
<p>The below search string was used for all countries.</p>
<p><code>“Country” “Statistical Department” and/or “Country” “Statistics” “Gov” </code></p>
<p>Once a countries statistical department was located, the term “Plastics” was searched in the search bar (if available). Any plastic production data displayed here was reviewed.</p>
<p>If no results were available further searches were carried out:</p>
<p><code>“Country” “Plastics Production” “Data” </code>
<code>“Country” “Production” “Data” </code></p>
<p>From here any data found was reviewed to determine if it fell under “Domestic Primary Plastics Production” or “Domestic Plastics Products”</p>
<p>For European countries, where better data was found using these search strings, this new data superseded the Eurostat data.</p>

<p>Products containing plastics may be captured in other categories – and similarly, some of the products reported may contain other materials. However, for the purposes of understanding whether countries report plastic product production data this has limited impact.</p>
<h3 id="plastics-consumption" tabindex="-1"><a class="observablehq-header-anchor" href="#plastics-consumption">Plastics Consumption</a></h3>
<p>Very few sources distinguish between the consumption of virgin plastics and consumption of recycled plastics. This limitation is reflected in the lower scores given to countries for this data type.</p>

<h5 id="european-data-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="observablehq-header-anchor" href="#european-data-1">European data</a></h5>
<p>Eurostat was used in the first instance to identify European Countries that reported Plastic Consumption data.</p>
<p>Eurostat allows users to filter “Domestic Material Consumption” of “Fossil energy materials/carriers”. Where countries reported this data, it was assumed that they collected and reported data on “Plastics Consumption” plus other uses of fossil energy materials/carriers such as electricity, fuel and manufacturing.</p>
<p>Because this consumption data was reported annually, but not split by plastics specifically, it was give a data score of:  *** (see table at the top of the page for description or rating).</p>
<h5 id="individual-country-data-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="observablehq-header-anchor" href="#individual-country-data-1">Individual country data</a></h5>

<p>For imports and exports of primary plastic material, the Standard international trade classification (SITC) code “575: Other Plastics, Primary form” was applied and an assessment was made as to whether each country annually reported this data to all “world” partners.</p>
<p>Where countries did not report data on COMTRADE, the following search string was used to identify data sources.</p>
<p><code>“Country” “Statistical Department” and/or “Country” “Statistics” “Gov” </code></p>
<p>Once a countries statistical department is located, the term “Trade” was searched in the search bar (if available). Any trade data displayed here was reviewed for plastics-related trade data.</p>
<p>If no plastics results were available, further searches were carried out in the search engine:</p>

<p>Once a countries statistical department is located, the term “Waste” was searched in the search bar (if available). Any waste data displayed here was reviewed and assessed to see if the country reported annual plastic waste data.</p>
